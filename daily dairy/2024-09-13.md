# Unauthorized Privilege Escalation and Ownership Manipulation

### **Description:**

The application has a critical vulnerability where an admin user can escalate their privileges to owner level and manipulate user roles, leading to potential account takeover and loss of control by the original owner. This issue stems from inadequate role-based access control (RBAC) and insufficient permission checks.

### **Reproduction Steps :**


1.  Create an owner account with full privileges.
2.  invite user as role admin(attacker). 
3.  login as admin to other browser than navigate to users management section. 

  ## Attack proceed

- **(Admin as Attacker) Upgrades Own Permissions**:  
    The **admin (attacker)**, User 1, upgrades their own role to **owner** without any involvement from the original owner. This bypasses the platform's role-based access control, as admins should not have permission to modify their own roles.
    
- **(Admin as Attacker) Takes Over Project**:  
    After upgrading to **owner**, the **admin (attacker)** gains critical control over the project. They can access sensitive permissions, monitor settings, and manage project data, leading to a full account takeover (ATO).
    
- **(Admin as Attacker) Downgrades or Deletes the Original Owner**:  
    With elevated permissions, the **admin (attacker)** can **downgrade** the original owner to a lower role or **delete** their account entirely. This locks the original owner out of their own project.
    
- **(Admin as Attacker) Invites and Manages New Owners**:  
    The **admin (attacker)**, now with **owner-level permissions**, can invite new users and assign them **owner** roles. They can also manage or delete the original owner and other users, leading to complete control over the project and sensitive data.

---
### **From the Attackerâ€™s Perspective (Admin) :**
The attacker (admin) escalates their privileges to owner by editing their own role, bypassing the original owner's control. They can invite new owners, downgrade or delete the original owner, access sensitive information (API keys, system settings), and delete projects, effectively taking over the platform entirely.

---
**Impact:**

- **Privilege Escalation**: Admins can elevate their own roles to owner level, bypassing proper access controls.
- **Loss of Control**: The original owner loses control over the platform, potentially resulting in data loss or project destruction.
- **Potential for Account Takeover**: Admins can delete or downgrade the original owner, locking them out and taking full control of the project.
- **Inconsistent Role Separation**: Admins gain unauthorized control over user roles, violating role-based access control principles.
