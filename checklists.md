### Vulnerability Checklist with Test Cases and Areas

Here's a detailed checklist of vulnerabilities with specific test cases and areas to focus on during security assessments:

#### 1. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
- **Unrestricted File Upload**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Attempt to upload files with different extensions (e.g., .php, .asp, .exe) to check if the server validates file types.
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Upload large files to test for size restrictions and server handling.
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Upload files with special characters in filenames to test for encoding and path traversal vulnerabilities.
  - **Area**: File upload endpoints, image upload forms, profile picture upload.

- **Path Traversal**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Upload a file with a filename like `../../../etc/passwd` to check if the server improperly handles file paths.
  - **Area**: File storage locations, directories accessible through the upload feature.

- **Content-Type Validation**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Change the `Content-Type` header in the request to an unexpected value and attempt the upload.
  - **Area**: HTTP request handling, backend file processing.

#### 2. **No Rate Limit**
- **Brute Force Attacks**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Attempt to login with multiple password guesses for a single user without being blocked.
  - **Area**: Login pages, password reset functionality.

- **Automated Requests**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Send numerous requests to the same endpoint in a short period and observe any rate-limiting mechanisms.
  - **Area**: API endpoints, search functions, registration forms.

#### 3. **Clickjacking**
- **Frame Busting**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Create a simple HTML page with an `iframe` that loads the target site and test if it can be framed.
  - **Area**: Critical pages like login, transaction confirmation, sensitive user actions.

- **Security Headers**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Check for the presence of the `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers in the response.
  - **Area**: HTTP response headers, server configuration.

#### 4. **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**
- **Object Identifier Testing**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Change object identifiers in the URL or request body to access unauthorized data (e.g., changing `user_id=123` to `user_id=124`).
  - **Area**: URL parameters, POST request bodies, session management.

- **Authorization Checks**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Attempt to access objects owned by other users or administrative objects without proper authorization.
  - **Area**: Profile pages, data records, file downloads.

#### 5. **Information Disclosure**
- **Error Messages**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Trigger different errors in the application (e.g., SQL errors, authentication errors) and check if detailed error messages are displayed.
  - **Area**: Form submissions, API endpoints, database interactions.

- **Sensitive Data in URLs**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Review URLs for sensitive information (e.g., session IDs, tokens, personal data).
  - **Area**: Query strings, URL fragments.

- **Server Information**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Check HTTP headers and error pages for server version details.
  - **Area**: Response headers, error handling pages.

#### 6. **Password Reset Functionality**
- **Token Handling**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Inspect the reset token mechanism for predictability or reuse.
  - **Area**: Password reset emails, reset links.

- **Email Enumeration**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Enter valid and invalid email addresses and observe if the system discloses which emails are registered.
  - **Area**: Forgot password forms, account recovery processes.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Attempt to request multiple password reset emails in quick succession.
  - **Area**: Password reset request endpoints.

#### 7. **No Rate Limit**
- **Brute Force Prevention**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Test login forms and other authentication mechanisms for lack of rate limiting.
  - **Area**: Login pages, registration forms, password reset functionality.

- **Resource Exhaustion**
  - [ ] **Test Case**: Send a high number of requests to a specific endpoint to test server stability and response handling.
  - **Area**: API endpoints, search functionalities, comment sections.

This checklist provides a structured approach to testing for specific vulnerabilities across different areas of a web application. Each test case aims to identify common weaknesses and ensure comprehensive coverage during security assessments.
