#### Steps for the Vulnerability

1. **Add "viticm" as a Member:**
   - The **attacker** adds **"viticm"** as a member to their project.

if want the id for that do step 1 
***only for getting id  the attack i did without add to member with viticm***

2. **Capture the Activity Log Request:**
   - **"viticm"** views the project and captures the request used to fetch the activity log. This can be done using tools like **Burp Suite** or **Browser Developer Tools**.

3. **Identify the `resource_id`:**
   - In the captured request, find the `resource_id` used in the API call to mark a resource as viewed. Example:
     ```json
     {
       "resource_id": "f519cc79-315d-4099-9cc7-71c253c98e40"
     }
     ```

4. **Replace `resource_id` with Attacker’s ID:**
   - **"viticm"** takes the `resource_id` from the attacker’s project (which **"viticm"** shouldn’t have access to) and replaces it in the request.

5. **Send the Modified Request:**
   - **"viticm"** sends the modified request with the attacker’s `resource_id` to the API.

6. **View Unauthorized Data:**
   - **"viticm"** now sees the attacker’s project details and activity logs that they shouldn't have access to.

#### Video POC Steps

1. Show how **attacker** adds **"viticm"** to a project.
2. Demonstrate how **"viticm"** captures the request used to fetch activity logs.
3. Show **"viticm"** identifying and replacing the `resource_id` with the attacker’s ID.
4. Display how **"viticm"** accesses unauthorized data from the attacker’s project.

### Impact for Developers

- **Unauthorized Access:** Users like **"viticm"** can access data and projects they shouldn't see.
- **Data Breach Risk:** Sensitive project information is exposed.
- **Compliance Issues:** Potential violations of data protection laws.
- **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose confidence in the platform’s security.

Make sure to implement strict access controls to prevent such unauthorized access.
